# Color-Dataset-Annotator
This is a repository for annotating a dataset of colors consisting of RGB values. This is a simple Flask-based web application for dataset annotation specifically for a dataset with three columns (red, green, blue, label).

# Setup:
* Step 1: Go inside the directory.
* Step 2: Execute "pip install -r requirements.txt"

# Run
* Step 1: Run "app.py", you can execute "python app.py" on the terminal relative to the main directory or folder or simply click the run button on VS Code.

Note:
* Change the CSV file on app.py to your most recent CSV checkpoint. If it is your first time, use "final_data_colors - Copy.csv"
* Use CTRL+F to easily find the colors you want to edit the labels with.
* We will combine the changes we made after confirming that we have finished if the color names assigned to each RGB value are correct.
